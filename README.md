# AniReco
An anime recommendation backend(for now) that accepts user specified parameters for JikanAPI request. Ditched the idea of implementing an algorithm to manually search for matches

This project shall serve as my training ground to have hands on learning of the following:
- Redis caching (already done but maybe needs improvement/optimization. My implementation feels lazy)
- User database (Relational)
- User authentication/authorization (guest, user, admin)
- Testings
- Deployment stuff (Docker, Cloud)
> Maybe focusing solely on that idea is not good so I'll probably explore other tools for other projects.
